The procession of buffaloes lasted three full hours, and it was night before the track was clear. The last ranks of the herd were now passing over the rails, while the first had already disappeared below the southern horizon.</p>

					<p class="newsContent"><img src="http://lorempixel.com/200/100/sports/?random=2">Phileas Fogg, as self-composed as if the judgment did not in the least concern him, did not even lift his eyebrows while it was being pronounced. Just as the clerk was calling the next case, he rose, and said, "I offer bail."
"You have that right," returned the judge.
Fix's blood ran cold, but he resumed his composure when he heard the judge announce that the bail required for each prisoner would be one thousand pounds.
"I will pay it at once," said Mr. Fogg, taking a roll of bank-bills from the carpet-bag, which Passepartout had by him, and placing them on the clerk's desk.
"This sum will be restored to you upon your release from prison," said the judge. "Meanwhile, you are liberated on bail."</p>

"Twenty thousand pounds!" cried Sullivan. "Twenty thousand pounds, which you would lose by a single accidental delay!"</p>

					<p class="newsContent"><img src="http://lorempixel.com/100/200/sports/?random=4"><p>Thus the night passed.  At dawn, the half-extinguished disc of the sun rose above a misty horizon; but it was now possible to recognise objects two miles off.  Phileas Fogg and the squad had gone southward; in the south all was still vacancy.  It was then seven o'clock.</p>

The captain, who was really alarmed, did not know what course to take.</p>
